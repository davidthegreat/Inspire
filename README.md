# Inspire
A 12 hour mini-hackathon project that uses the Alchemy API / IBM Watson to analyze whether your inspirational tidbit "measures up" against figures in history.

## Our Concept
The idea melds the concept of using a machine learning api and random human content to produce interesting and thought-provoking results. Your inspirational quote is evaluated for positivity and scored by Alchemy; the result is charted to allow you to compare against great figures in history.
